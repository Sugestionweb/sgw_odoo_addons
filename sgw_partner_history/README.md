# SGW Partner History

This module keeps track of all the fields of the customer file so that, every time a
change is made, it adds a message in the chatter at the bottom. For example, by default,
Odoo does not track these fields and if we change the email address of a customer, it
will not post it anywhere, it will only make the change. However, by installing this
module, it will follow up and add a note with the changes to the chatter.

## Installation

You can download the module from the github repository, copy it to an addons folder that
is included in the odoo path and install it like any other odoo module.

## Use

To see the changes go to customer and change some data, you will se in the chatter the
changes.
